    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> There are certain recipes that are essential to have in your recipe box and one of them has to be a phenomenal Fettuccine alfredo recipe.  Years ago, when I was teaching kids' cooking classes, this was one of the first things I taught them. Almost every single kid around goes crazy for alfredo sauce! It is so easy to make a homemade alfredo sauce that you will never buy the jarred variety again!
      This homemade alfredo sauce is made with simple ingredients -- butter, parmesan cheese, garlic, heavy cream, and salt. It's a 5-ingredient alfredo sauce that is beyond easy! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb Fettuccine Pasta</li>
      <li>Tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>1 Garlic Clove (minced)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Heavy Cream</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon Pepper</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons Italian Parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions. </li>
      <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. </li>
      <li>Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
      <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
      <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
      <li>Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.</li>
    </ol>
